Hello!

I decided to publish my completed homework on ML naturally in python
I want to share that it was a very good course with an even better teacher - Ogul Unal, many thanks to him for his knowledge and patience in his work.
This course starts with the basics - data types, structures, etc. But very interesting things from the world of ML will soon begin - regressoins, outliers, datasets, predictions and so on

Have fun with this examples!
