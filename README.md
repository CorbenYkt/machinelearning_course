Hello!

I decided to publish my completed tasks on course of Machine Learning in Python. I had to cut some part of the material because it is copyrighted, and the author of this course is not me, but Ogul Unal. I want to share that it was a very good course with an even better teacher - Ogul Unal, many thanks to him for his knowledge and patience in his work.
This course starts with the basics - data types, structures, etc. But very interesting things from the world of ML will soon begin - regressions, outliers, datasets, predictions and so on

Task - Description
-----------------------------
1 - Here we are only getting acquainted with jupyter, python and data types<br>
2 - Getting acquainted with working with arrays, the NumPy library<br>
3 - Panda and DataFrame's<br>
4 - Chart and working with it. Beautiful design and all that. Correctly presented data is half the success))<br>
5 - A simple example of working with REST API<br>
6 - The hard life begins. Linear and Polynomial Regression. Such concepts as - Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F-Score & Specificity. We work with an example about Absence from work. Great warm-up. Here and re-encoding of data, their assessment, and so on.<br>
7 - Regressions. Here we consider an example with the cost of housing. MAE, MSE, R2 and etc.<br>
8 - An example about pulsating stars and heart attacks. By this time we already know about XGBoost. We got acquainted with the classification task.<br>
9 - The folder is divided into two.
    9.1 - Facedetection. The simplest definition of the face contour, no matter whose, just a face.
    9.2 - Face Recognition, contours of a specific person. In order for the face contours to be determined and the inscription with the name of the face to be displayed, you need to upload a bunch of photos of the face with different facial expressions. Teach the model and connect it.<br>
10 - The task about the cost of avocado. As it turned out, there are nuances both with the initial data and with outliers. In general, it was interesting to figure it out.<br>
11 - Convolutional Neural Networks - Mindblowing thing!<br>
12 - The task about dogs and cats. Initially, it ran on Google Cloud, so I did not attach the original data here. They are available by link inside the document. You just download the archive and connect it in Google Colab. By the way, since the data is not balanced, I had to use Augmentation methods<br>
13 - An example of a task to determine emotions on a person's face. There is a set of original data according to which it is necessary to teach and train the machine. Further, the use of a camera and reading information from it follows.<br>

For the correct operation of task 13, you will need to have:
haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
lbph_classifierGestures.yml

they can be downloaded, they are in free access and here I do not attach them so as not to clutter up GIT.

Have fun with these examples!
